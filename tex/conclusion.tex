\section{Conclusion}
While much recent work has built systems to support learning and data
science, in this work we use learning and data to build better
systems.  Specifically we propose \SYSTEM{}, a combination of machine
learning and control for managing resources to meet performance
requirements with minimal energy.  \SYSTEM{}'s unique contributions
are (1) breaking resource allocation into two sub-tasks: learning
complexity and controlling dynamics; and (2) proposing an interface
that combines the two efficiently while maintaining formal guarantees
that the combination will converge to the desired performance. Our
empirical results show that this combination produces more reliable
performance and lower energy than either learning or control alone.
