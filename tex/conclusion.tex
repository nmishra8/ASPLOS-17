\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents \SYSTEM{}, a combination of machine learning and
control for managing resources in mobile systems.  One of the key
enablers for this approach is the interface that allows the learned
models to be applied efficiently.  We propose the performance hash
table to serve as this interface.  While our specific implementation
is tailored for the problem of meeting a performance constraint with
minimal energy, we believe this data structure is generally useful for
problems where a computing system must meet a constraint in one
dimension while optimizing some other dimension.

\SYSTEM{} is well-suited to managing the twin challenges of modeling
system complexity and reacting to system dynamics.  We have compared
\SYSTEM{} to prior learning and control approaches and find that
\SYSTEM{} delivers more reliable performance with lower energy both in
a quiescent device, where the controlled application is the only one
running, and in a more realistic scenario where other applications can
interfere with the managed application.  \SYSTEM{}'s ability to manage
both complexity and dynamics make it well-suited to managing modern
mobile devices which must deliver reliable performance to users while
dealing with energy limitations.
