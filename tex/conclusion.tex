\section{Conclusion}
Much recent work builds systems to support learning, \SYSTEM{} uses
learning to build better systems.  \SYSTEM{} is a resource manager
that meets application latency requirements with minimal energy, even
without prior knowledge of the application.  \SYSTEM{} is the first
work that provides formal guarantees that it will converge to the
required latency despite not having prior knowledge.  \SYSTEM{}
achieves this breakthrough by using learning to model complex resource
interaction and control theory to manage system dynamics.  \SYSTEM{}
proposes foundational techniques that allow control to be applied
using noisy learned models---instead of ground truth models---while
maintaining formal guarantees.  We demonstrate \SYSTEM{}'s
effectiveness with a case study using embedded applications on a
heterogeneous processor.  Compared to prior learning and control
approaches, \SYSTEM{} is the only approach that provides reliable
latency for all applications with near minimal energy.
