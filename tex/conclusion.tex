\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents \SYSTEM{}, a combination of machine learning and
control for managing resources in mobile systems.  We have compared
\SYSTEM{} to prior learning and control approaches and find that
\SYSTEM{} delivers more reliable performance with lower energy both in
a quiescent device, where the controlled application is the only one
running, and in a more realistic scenario where other applications can
interfere with the managed application.  \SYSTEM{}'s ability to manage
both complexity and dynamics make it well-suited to managing modern
mobile devices which must deliver reliable performance to users while
dealing with energy limitations.
