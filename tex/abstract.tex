  Mobile systems must deliver performance to interactive applications
  and conserve resources to extend battery life.  There are two
  central challenges to meeting these conflicting goals: (1) the
  complicated optimization spaces arising from hardware heterogeneity
  and (2) dynamic changes in resource availability and application
  behavior.  Machine learning techniques handle complicated
  optimization spaces, but do not incorporate models of system
  dynamics; control theory provides formal guarantees of dynamic
  behavior, but cannot handle non-linear system models.  In this
  paper, we propose a combination of learning and control techniques
  to meet mobile system's performance requirements on heterogeneous
  devices in unpredictable environments.  Specifically, we propose
  \SYSTEM{}, which combines a hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) with a
  lightweight control system (LCS).  The HBM runs on a remote server,
  learning customized performance/power models by aggregating data
  across devices.  The LCS runs on the mobile system and tunes
  resource usage to meet performance requirements efficiently. We
  propose a unique interface, the Performance Hash Table (PHT) which
  allows the LCS to apply the learned models in constant time.  We
  implement \SYSTEM{} and test its ability to manage ARM big.LITTLE
  systems.  Compared to existing learning and control methods,
  \SYSTEM{} delivers more reliable performance -- only 2.1\% error
  compared to 3.4-5.4\% for learning and 4.6\% for control -- and lower
  energy -- achieving 7\% of optimal as compared to by 25-52\% over
  learning and 26\% over control.  In a scenario where multiple
  applications compete for resources, these numbers improve: 7\%
  error compared to 11-15\% for learning and 9\% for control and
  improvements of 2-20\% and 3\%, respectively, in energy efficiency.
